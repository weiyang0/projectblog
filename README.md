A simple blog website. This project was to learn about how to approach building a site from a given design template, structuring the HTML, and using CSS Flexbox for layout and styles. It was also an introduction to responsive design, taking the mobile-first approach when developing a site.

## Overall process of the project:

- Based on given design, break it up into sections
- Set up structure in HTML for Homepage
- Add CSS styles, using mobile-first approach
- Use flexbox to change visual order of elements
- Add CSS media queries for larger screen sizes
- Create Recent Posts and About Me page using elements already created in Homepage
- Link up all pages

For the most part, there were not many difficulties during the process. The CSS styling was still manageable, but it took a while to figure it out at times, especially when using flexbox.
